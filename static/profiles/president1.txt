Hello friends! I’m Kevin (P.), ES ‘16, and I hail from the wild realm of Ohio, from a suburb devoid of much cultural diversity. When I’m not doing Asian things, you can find me playing in DPops and SYO, raising roundworms at the School of Medicine, crying over Kdramas, or getting fat from baked goods and ice cream. I also go to school.
 
I got involved with ViSA last year to make up for this lack of culture in my life, and to obey my mother by making lots of “nice Vietnamese friends”. After a term as social chair, I now humbly serve as co-president of the most beautiful and talented cultural group on campus. I hope you’ll join me and the rest of ViSA in having a fun and delicious year!
 
See you at our next event (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
